## Maze

How to run 

`git clone https://github.com/dmytroserhiienko02/Maze`

`cd Maze`

Run main 
`go run main.go`

Input height and width. For example: 
20 20

Approximate time for completing the task is 15 hours.


A depth-first and backtracking approach was used to generate the maze. A queue was used for backtracking. To find the shortest path, we used the width search. The time complexity in O notation is n*m where n,m are the height and width of the maze.
